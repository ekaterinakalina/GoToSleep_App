# GoToSleep_App

Go to sleep: the sleep cycle app

👩‍💻 Hi, I am **Ekaterina, UX/UI Designer** with coding skills.

Thanks for having a look at my very first iOS app: Go to sleep. 
This app was my final project at the end of the course **“App Development: iOS Basic course”** (Cimdata|Germany, August 2023).

The given challenge was building a data-centred app using Swift, SwiftUI Framework, XCode.

**Programming:**
- Data structure “Cycle”
- DataController ObservableObject: upload the data from the “Cycle” structure in an array
- Function that counts 7 sleep cycles according to the actual user time, output as string array

**UI:**
- Screens: SplashScreens, MainView
- Structs: HamburgerButton, SetButton, SideBarView, ListView   
- Extensions, Assets
- Binding the data onto the UI elements

**Future plans:**
- develop a UX case
- upgrade UI, UIKit depending on the user needs
- further screen developing!
