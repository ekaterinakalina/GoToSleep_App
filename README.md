# GoToSleep_App

Go to sleep: the sleep cycle app

Hi, I’m Ekaterina. Thanks for having a look at my very first iOS app: Go to sleep. 
This app was my final project at the end of the course “App Development: iOS Basic course”, August 2023.

My future plans are:

UX case;
UI upgrade;
further developing!
